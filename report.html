                <h1>REPORT</h1>
                <h2>Site report </h2>
                <p>I am a computer Science student at the university of Northampton. In My 1st year of computer Science,
                    We have the module Web development. The module deals with designing, making and using the website.
                    Making of the websites includes the proper usage of the languages like HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
                    After several number of requisite classes where we learnt about the basics, syntax and where should
                    we use them in which we have covered all the important concepts of HTML and CSS. We also learnt how
                    to use git and the github, they include creating a github account, making repositories, making
                    commits, making branches and merging them and so on …
                    The coursework is well designed for the students to explore the ocean of coding by making a
                    portfolio website. This is an individual project where each student should create his/her own
                    portfolio website which consist professional information such as his/her work and their skills. This
                    allows the student to explore the wide range of features and properties of the languages and helps
                    them to understand the actual process of making a website. It is a great opportunity to understand
                    the lesions which they have learnt in the class and implement in their project and also expressing
                    their creativity in the website.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h4>2.BUILDING THE LAYOUT</h4>
            <p>The layout is already done which I drew in notebook. Now its time to build the site!!
                I have created a html for each of the page on the website and created 3 css style sheets which are
                desktop.css, master.css and mobile.css. By using the grid I have designed the layout which I chose and
                made the fundamental structure of the website. I used nav, main and the footer. I added the background
                colours to each of the element which I liked the most.
            </p>
            <h4>3.NAV AND FOOTER </h4>
            <p>After the layout I added the navigation items which consists of the names of all the other pages. The
                navigation and footer bar is going to be in all the pages so that the user can switch the pages no
                matter in which page they are. I used the tags such as ul and li to add the names of the pages and
                styled it according to my design.</p>
            <h4>4.ADDED THE CONTENT </h4>
            <p>Now as the navigation and the footer is set I have added the appropriate content for each page and styled
                them using various fonts , colours , headings and subheadings. I have also added few related images for
                the content to make to more interesting. I have adjusted the font and the picture size accordingly.</p>
            <h4>5.MOBILE VERSION</h4>
            <p>The website also works on the mobile. I styled it such a way that website perfectly works on the smaller
                screens such as mobiles as well. It also comes with navigation bar button(Hamburger Icon), when clicking
                it the navigation items get opened. The site is well designed so that the content inside doesn’t get
                overlapped by each other.</p>
            <h4>FEW MENTIONABLE ELEMENTS</h4>
            <p>In the entire project I have used the github. By making several commits each time I make a reasonable
                change in the site. I have also created few branches to make or add new elements and merged them with my
                master code.</p>
            <h4>Conclusion </h4>
            <p>I don’t really have a much knowledge about the languages such as html and the css at the beginning of the
                module. Now, I have understood all the syntax, properties and their features , This project really
                helped my to explore things and understand it. With my tutors help and exploring and learning things on
                the internet helped me to gain the confidence and grip in this languages.</p>
