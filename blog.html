                    <p>It may be an intriguing topic for some of you, but let me make it simple for you!</p>
                    <p>The Internet is an ocean of information. All you search about is information in Google , Yahoo ,
                        or Mozilla Firefox . Even in your online exams, all you use is Google and your little brain. You
                        surf the internet , grab information, and sometimes learn from the websites .But, there are a
                        few sites on the internet that you can’t access. These sites are called dark web or dark sites.
                        They are used to hack information or data. These sites are not available on google, yahoo, or
                        any other web pages. You need other specifications to access these web pages.The dark web refers
                        to content that isn’t categorized by search engines and that requires special software or
                        approval to access these sites. Dark web content lives on the darknet, a portion of the internet
                        accessible only to personal browsers or through particular network formats.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Now here the question arises, what are the dark web, deep web, and surface web?</h4>
                    <p>The Internet is big with millions of web pages, databases, and servers all running 24 hours a
                        day. But the so-called "visible" Internet (aka surface web or open web) — sites that can be
                        organized using search engines like Google and Yahoo — is just the tip of the iceberg.There are
                        several terms surrounding the non-visible Web, but it's worth knowing how they differ if you're
                        planning to browse off the beaten path.</p>
                    <h4>The surface web or open web
                        The open web, or surface web,</h4>
                    <p>is the “visible” surface sheet. If we continue to make up the entire web like an iceberg, the
                        open web would be the top portion that’s above the water. From a statistical perspective, this
                        combination of websites and data makes up to 5% of the total internet.All normally public-facing
                        websites accessed via traditional browsers like Google Chrome, Internet Explorer and Firefox are
                        contained here. Websites are usually tagged with registry operators like “.com” and “.org” and
                        can be easily located with popular search engines.Locating surface web websites is feasible
                        because search engines can index the web via noticeable links (a process called “crawling” due
                        to the examination engine traveling the web like a spider).</p>
                    <h4>The deep web</h4>
                    <p>The deep web rests below the surface and summaries for roughly 90% of all websites. This would be
                        the part of an iceberg beneath the water, much larger than the surface web. This hidden web is
                        so large that it's difficult to discover precisely how many pages or websites are active at any
                        instant of time.
                        Carrying on with the analogy, big search devices could be considered like fishing boats that can
                        only "catch" websites close to the surface. Everything else, from academic journals to private
                        databases and more criminal content, is out of reach. This deep web also includes the quantity
                        that we know as the dark web.

                        What Is the Dark Web and How to Access It?
                        The websites you visit every day represent barely a small fraction of the whole internet.
                        Farther this “surface web” is the deep web, and within the deep web is the dark web.

                        Find out what the dark web is and how you can access it. Then get a data-monitoring tool like
                        Avast Breach Guard to keep your personal information safe.
                    </p>
                    <h4>How to access the dark web safely</h4>
                    <p>The safest way to get on the dark web is through the Tor network. For added safety, first,
                        connect to a VPN , then use Tor in a practice known as Tor-over-VPN. Many Internet Service
                        providers (ISPs) and governments may be cautious of Tor use, and a VPN will hide your internet
                        workout and prevent anyone from knowing that you’re borrowing Tor.Connect to a reliable and safe
                        VPN.
                        Hide your IP address and encrypt your internet connection with a trustworthy VPN like NordVPN
                        and Express VPN. Although they both provide encryption, a VPN, and a Tor is not the same thing.
                        A VPN will prevent your ISP and anyone else from understanding that you're downloading and using
                        Tor Browser.


                        Download and install Tor Browser.
                        Tor Browser is an unrestricted browser that routes your traffic through the encrypted Tor
                        network. Download Tor Browser from the official Tor Project website, because unlicensed
                        third-party downloads may come bundled with malware.


                        Browse the dark web with Tor Browser.
                        Tor Browser will let you admission the .onion domains of the dark web. Because the dark web is
                        largely unregulated, never visit dark websites without first confirming their genuineness.


                        Protect your identity.
                        The dark website isn’t always dangerous, but many scams do exist. When communicating or making
                        purchases over the shady web, use encrypted and unspecified email addresses and pay with an
                        unspecified cryptocurrency wallet.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Is the dark web used for illegal purposes?</h4>
                    <p>Yes, the murky web is used for illegal activities. It’s possible to buy and sell illegal drugs,
                        malware, and prohibited content in darknet marketing places. Some dark-web commerce sites have
                        hazardous chemicals and weapons for sale.Some cyberpunks offer ransomware as a service (RaaS),
                        where cybercriminals can “rent” a strain of ransomware from its creator in exchange for a fee or
                        a percentage of their ransom expenditures. Others sell software exploits that other
                        cybercriminals can use to infect victims with malware and snatch personal data.


                        The vastly well-known dark web marketplace was the Silk Road, which was inaugurated in 2011 and
                        virtually functioned as an Amazon-like market for illegal drugs. In 2013, the FBI shut down the
                        Silk Road, and its founder, Ross Ulbricht, is now fulfilling a double life sentence. It was the
                        biggest criminal trial in the history of the internet.


                        Fraud and scams run widespread on the dark web: offers too good to be true and fake services
                        requiring upfront payment. Hackers sell access to email accounts, social media silhouettes , or
                        other information that can be used for identity theft.


                        Avast Breach guard helps to keep your data off the dark web. By regulating known dark web
                        marketplaces, Avast Breach Guard will alert you instantly if and when your data is made usable
                        for sale. That way, you can alter your passwords and protect your accounts before anyone can use
                        your data against you. For getting an Avast breach guard online you can find the link in the
                        description box, and to know more about VPNs you can find our video in the i-button above or in
                        the description box.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Is the dark web dangerous?</h4>
                    <p>The dark web can certainly be dangerous — with no regulation, it’s a more hazardous place to hang
                        out than the surface web. Malware and scams are scattered like landmines around the dark web.
                        And with many unfamiliar-looking sites on the dark web, it’s harder to distinguish safe websites
                        from shady ones and susceptible to falling, victim.


                        Regular dark web visitors know that it’s possible to exploit the sketchy reputation of the space
                        and the employment offered. And though some dark web marketplaces offer user reviews, not all
                        do. Lack of regulation by authorities or other users gives rise to it easy for cybercrime on
                        unfamiliar-looking sites.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Is it illegal to access the dark web?</h4>
                    <p>The legality of accessing the dark web varies from country to country. In the US, visiting the
                        dark web is legal, though using Tor without the safety of a VPN may draw scrutiny from your ISP
                        as well as from the government.

                        And while visiting the dark network may be legal, using it to entertain in criminal activity is
                        not.


                        The primary role of the dark web is anonymous browsing. Some people use this anonymity for
                        illegal reasons, but the dark web’s privacy protections are crucial for activists and
                        informants.

                        Dark web domains can be crucial for those living in countries where free speech is limited or
                        banned and who want to share information or organize without being prosecuted.


                        So is the dark web illegal? On its own, no — but accessing it might be, being sure of where you
                        are. Always check your local laws before visiting the dark web, using Tor, or using a VPN.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Keeping yourself (and your data) off the dark web</h4>
                    <p>Data breaches happen all the time, and your login credentials and other data might be on the dark
                        web already. Unless you’re on the dark web yourself, the only way to realize whether or not
                        someone is selling your data is to perform a dark web scan.


                        Avast Breach Guard scans the dark web and will alert you instantly if and when it detects your
                        data.


                        Breach Guard will guide you through the process of recouping your accounts and protecting them
                        before a hacker can use your leaked credentials. Secure your data and keep hackers out of your
                        report with a specialized dark web monitoring tool.
                    </p>
                    <h4>What happens on the dark web today?</h4>
                    <p>Because privacy and anonymity are the hallmarks of the dark web, it’s easy to determine that
                        everything that happens there is illegal. And while sufficient cybercrime does take place, the
                        dark web is used legally as well.


                        Some people simply prefer not to present any information online and use Tor to access normal
                        websites outside the dark web or to visit dark web news websites and symposia.
                        So that’s it for today, my friends!
